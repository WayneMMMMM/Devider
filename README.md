# Divider


The dataset: 
 A large quantity of HTML files needs to be indexed by a search engine. Many of them are combined into a single XML file which can be difficult to work with the search engine's API. Therefore, before indexing, each pair of HTML tag needs to be extracted from the XML files. 

About Divider:
This is a helper function written in Java that can search for HTML tags inside XML files. It then will extract each pair of HTML tags and create a HTML document for each pair. These HTML documents can then be indexed by the search engine's API.
